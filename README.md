# Visualizing Parking Tickets across Philadelphia

This repo holds the source code for https://www.parkingjawn.com.

We use the [dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com), and [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs) to visualize the parking tickets across Philly on a monthly basis. 

Data is available via Philadelphia's open data website, [Open Data Philly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/parking-violations).
